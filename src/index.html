            The proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus) or long nosed monkey is a rainforest primate
            found only in Borneo. Because of its distinctive appearance and its unique adaptations,
            it is a species of considerable scientific interest, especially for its physical and
            behavioral adaptations to a particular and often threatened habitat.

            Males of proboscis monkeys have large noses, which are especially prominent. The noses â€”
            which are ideally positioned to couple the nose cavities â€” might be useful at amplifying
            vocalizations, which could thereby entice rivals and mates to within the group's domain.
            Females reach about 66-76 cm, males are slightly larger.

            Another difference is that of the monkeyâ€™s pot bellied shape â€” developed from a uniquely
            adapted digestive system to a folivorous diet (mostly leaves). The multi chambered
            stomachs of this system break down the fibrous leaves they consume. They also have
            reddish brown coats and a white tipped tail, making them also proboscis monkeys.

            Borneo is an island shared by Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei and the proboscis monkey is
            endemic to the island. They are found mainly in lowland rainforest, swamp and mangrove
            forest close to river and coastal areas. It is important to be so close to water as
            proboscis monkeys are one of the best swimmers among primates, using their partially
            webbed feet to swim rivers and escape predators. But they depend on particular habitats,
            and habitat loss from deforestation and land conversion for agriculture makes them
            vulnerable.

            The proboscis monkey is largely folivorous, but with some seasonal dietary shifts to
            include fruits, seeds and occasionally flowers, in their diet. Because their digestive
            systems are specialized to remove nutrients from cellulose in fibrous vegetation that
            other animals might find more trouble digesting, they donâ€™t need to be frightened of
            being prey. Young leaves are preferred, since they are easier to digest. When available,
            proboscis monkeys will eat fruit, but too much fruit can throw them out of balance. This
            selectivity in food makes them more dependent on the kinds of vegetation they must have,
            and thus the native habitats.

          <hr />
          <p>
            Proboscis monkeys are socially grouped, or haremed, usually comprised of one dominant
            male and several females and their offspring. Security and reproductive success of
            dominant male are provided by this structure. All members of the group help protect and
            nurture infants, although females are the only ones known to be the primary caregivers
            of their young. Bachelors groups of young males, in which males remain until they are
            able to form harems, are also common. This group dynamic is vital to their survival: if
            they didn't have it, each wildebeest would be much more likely to be bitten, killed and
            fed to a crocodile or a bird of prey.

            Female proboscis monkeys become sexually mature at about five years of age, and males
            not until about seven years of age. The species has a gestation period of approximately
            166 days, and has a litter size of one offspring and mothers produce only one offspring
            at a time. Blue faces and dark fur are distinctive of infants, but change as they
            mature. It's important for maternal care during the early stages: young monkeys tend to
            stick with their mother, they don't want to get far away from her, and they gradually
            pull away to become a part of a group as they get bigger.

          <p>
            Proboscis monkeys are classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List for a number of
            reasons, the most important of which is their continued loss of habitat due to hunting
            and human encroachment. Their available habitats have been greatly reduced by
            deforestation, especially for palm oil plantations. Their populations have been affected
            too: by hunting for food and the illegal pet trade. These primates need to be conserved,
            and some success has been achieved in creating reserves and protected areas on Borneo.
            Long term conservation also includes both international awareness and sustainable
            practices in industries that impact their habitatâ€”such as logging and agriculture.

          <p>
            The proboscis monkey is a special and important part of the Bornean ecosystem. We show
            how its adaptations to a specialized diet and habitat, distinctive physical features,
            and complex social structures emphasize the diversity of primate evolution. However,
            this species is very closely tied to the survival of Borneoâ€™s rainforests and its
            careful management of human activity. If we can continue to protect these fabulous
            primates and protect them for countless generations to come, it can be done.
